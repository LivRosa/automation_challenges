# Project for Practicing Test Automation with Cypress

## Objective: 🎯
The goal of this project is to practice and enhance skills in test automation using Cypress, initially focusing on Front-End testing to establish a solid foundation. The first phase of the project will be dedicated to automating user interface (UI) tests, and upon completing the UI test phase, the goal is to expand test coverage and further improve automation skills.

## Key Features 🚀
Test Automation Framework: Using Cypress to automate functional and regression tests.
Front-End Testing: Focus on automating UI tests such as form interactions, content validation, and navigation.
Test Coverage: Initially, the project will include smoke tests and more comprehensive end-to-end tests, focusing on UI quality.
